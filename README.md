# MNIST-digit-detection

## Project
This project contains a basic implementation of a neural network. The goal of the network is to predict the MNIST dataset.

I plan to add some other AI techniques in the future that can also be trained with the MNIST dataset.

## Execute the code
To see the result of the code is just execute network.py.
```
  python network.py
```
Furthermore, you can try to play around with some parameters. For example, you can change the mini batch size, the learning rate, the epochs or the layout of the network.
In addition, it is possible to implement other activation functions, a different weight and bias initializations or other cost functions.

## Further reading
I really recommend you to read the book of Michael Nielsen. (IT'S FREE)
